 # Extra Planet Classes
 ####################################
 pc_methane:0 "Methane World"
 pc_methane_desc:0 "Rocky world with a nitrogen-methane atmosphere atmosphere. This planet's variable gas is methane.  With temperatures around -180 degrees Celsius the methane hydrosphere is stable."
 pc_ammonia:0 "Ammonia World"
 pc_ammonia_desc:0 "Rocky world with a nitrogen-ammonia atmosphere. This planet's variable gas is ammonia.  With temperatures around -100 degrees Celsius, the ammonia hydrosphere is stable."
  
 pc_cascadian:0 "Cascadian World"
 pc_cascadian_desc:0 "Cool, wet, rocky world with a nitrogen-oxygen atmosphere, consisting of boreal forests and towering mountain ranges. An active, stormy, hydrosphere makes for snowy winters and rainy summers."
 pc_swamp:0 "Swamp World"
 pc_swamp_desc:0 "Warm, muddy world with a thick nitrogen-oxygen atmosphere. Seasonal variation is limited, with significant precipitation. Most landmasses are covered in dense vegetation."
 pc_oasis:0 "Oasis World"
 pc_oasis_desc:0 "Dry rocky world with a nitrogen-oxygen atmosphere. Hydrosphere only supports one large body of water which has a band of vegetation around it. Rain barely reaches the inland desert that covers the majority of the planet."
 pc_steppe:0 "Steppe World"
 pc_steppe_desc:0 "Dry, rocky world with a nitrogen-oxygen atmosphere. Low amounts of precipitation and cold temperatures keep the planet in a thin layer of snow most of the year. The landscape is covered in grass and shrubs during the short summer months."
 pc_frozen_desert:0 "Desolate World"
 pc_frozen_desert_desc:0 "Chilly, rocky world with a nitrogen-oxygen atmosphere. Precipitation is low and major bodies of surface water are rare."
 pc_mesa:0 "Arroyo World"
 pc_mesa_desc:0 "Warm, dry, rocky world with a nitrogen-oxygen atmosphere. Great plateaus and mesas are common around the equator, with cooler forested polar regions. Hydrosphere consists mostly of large rivers and seasonal arroyos that have cut canyons in the landscape, with vegetation lining the riverbeds."
 pc_hadesert:0 "Badlands World"
 pc_hadesert_desc:0 "Extremely dry, rocky world with a nitrogen-oxygen atmosphere.  High-altitude peaks cause rain shadows for most of the planet, and salt flats and arid vallesy make up most of the level land. Hydrosphere is in a few lakes and mountain springs."
 pc_geothermal:0 "Interglacial World"
 pc_geothermal_desc:0 "Cold, icy planet with a nitrogen-oxygen atmosphere. Patches of warmer landscape break up the expanses of glacial ice, often heated by natural geothermal vents. Hydrosphere is in meltwater and steam rising from vents."
 pc_desertislands:0 "Atoll World"
 pc_desertislands_desc:0 "Hot, rocky planet with a nitrogen-oxygen atmosphereand signifcant hydrosphere, with water covering more than §Y90%§! of the surface. Temperatures at the equator are too hot for rain most of the year, making vegetation scarce, but polar regions receive considerable precipitation that supports an abundance of life." 
 pc_sandsea:0 "Dune World"
 pc_sandsea_desc:0 "Hot, extremely dry, rocky planet with a nitrogen-oxygen atmosphere. Seas of sand dunes cover a considerable portion of the surface. Hydrosphere is mainly in underground aquifers that rise up in oases and mountain springs. Precipitation is almost non-existent"
 pc_mangrove:0 "Mangrove World"
 pc_mangrove_desc:0 "Warm, rocky world with a nitrogen-oxygen atmosphere and signifcant hydrosphere. More than §Y90%§! of the planet is covered in shallow seas with very little land above sea level. Jungles extended for hundreds of miles beyond the shores of the few existing islands, supporting a great abundance of plant and animal life." 
 pc_glacial:0 "Glacial World"
 pc_glacial_desc:0 "Frigid, icy world with a nitrogen-oxygen atmosphere. Significant water deposits can be found permanently frozen as glacial ice, covering more than §Y90%§! of the planet, with very little melting over the summer months. Geothermal activity supports an abundance of marine life under the thick surface ice."
 pc_subarctic:0 "Ice Floe World"
 pc_subarctic_desc:0 "Chilly, rocky world with a nitrogen-oxygen atmosphere and a significant hydrosphere. Oceans, sea ice, and polar ice caps cover more than §Y90%§! of the surface, with rugged scattered islands dotting its surface.  An abundance of volcanic and geothermal activity supports marine ecosystems."
 pc_hajungle:0 "Cloud Forest World"
 pc_hajungle_desc:0 "Warm, rocky world with a nitrogen-oxygen atmosphere. Hydrosphere is mostly in low altitude seas, which cause considerable fog and cloud cover. In the higher altitudes, standing water is rare and most plant life relies on the mist and fog."
 pc_antarctic:0 "Antarctic World"
 pc_antarctic_desc:0 "Frigid, rocky world with a nitrogen-oxygen atmosphere. Hydrosphere is minimal, and mostly frozen, with virtually no precipitation.  While winds can reach speeds of over 250 km per hour in the winter months, life can be found in isolated pockets under sea ice, in caves, and in protected valleys."
